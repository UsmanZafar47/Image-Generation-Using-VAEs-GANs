# Image-Generation-Using-VAEs-GANs
Built and compared VAE and GAN models for generating realistic images of cats and dogs (CIFAR-10), and  implemented a CycleGAN for translating face sketches to real photos. Developed a Vision Transformer for image  classification, and a multimodal RAG system for answering text/image-based questions using PDF content.
